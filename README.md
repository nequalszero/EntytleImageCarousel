### Summary
This front end web application is built with `React`, with the JavaScript files bundled together via `webpack` into the `src/bundle.js` file.  

### Download Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install`
3. To open application locally, open `index.html` in the browser.

To easily make changes, start the `webpack-dev-server` by running `npm start` (short for `webpack-dev-server --hot --inline` as seen in `package.json`) and go to `http://localhost:8080/`.
